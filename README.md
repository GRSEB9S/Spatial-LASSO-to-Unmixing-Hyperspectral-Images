# SPLASSO

 - An implementation of the spatial LASSO technique for HSI (Hyperspectral Images) unmixing.
 
 - Based on: 
 
 The Spatial LASSO With Applications to Unmixing Hyperspectral Biomedical Images
 Daniel V. Samarov, Jeeseong Hwang & Maritoni Litorja
 Technometrics Vol. 57 , Iss. 4,2015

 - To compute regular LASSO with positive constraints for the estimated parameters, a function (l1_ls_nonneg.m) from the following package is used:
